# IGME 531 Project 2

This project showcases the implementation of recursive fractal patterns using React-Three-Fiber and React-Three-CSG to generate a 3D scene. Among these patterns is an implementation of a Pythagoras tree and an unused Sierpinski pyramid algorithm.

## Project Overview

- **Fractal Patterns**: The project explores various implementations of recursive fractal patterns.
- **CSG Library**: The main component, `ResultTree`, utilizes the CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) library to handle mesh returns.
- **Pythagoras Tree**: The current implementation of the Pythagoras tree involves transforming ShapePaths into compatible buffer geometry. It merges all instances into one buffered instance and utilizes a secondary tree for subtraction.

## Current Status

- **3D Printing Issues**: The project is currently encountering difficulties with 3D printing. However, the generated STL result appears clean.
- **To Run the Project**: Use npm or bun to run the project.
